# Module common/common.lua

## Class ac.GenericList
FFI-accelerated list, acts like a regular list (consequent items, size and capacity, automatically growing, etc.)
Doesn’t store nil values to act more like a Lua table.

Few notes:
• Use `:get()` and `:set()` to access elements instead of square brakets;
• Indices are 1-based;
• For fastest access to individual elements use `.raw` field: it’s a raw pointer, so use 0-based indices there and
make sure not to access things outside of list size.

For slightly better performance it might be benefitial to preallocate memory with `list:reserve(expectedSizeOrABitMore)`.

- `ac.GenericList:get(index)`

  Return an element at given index.

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

  Returns:

    - `any`

- `ac.GenericList:set(index, value)`

  Sets an element at given index.

  Parameters:

    1. `index`: `integer` 1-based index.

    2. `value`: `any`

- `ac.GenericList:size()`

  Number of items in the list.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:sizeBytes()`

  Size of list in bytes (not capacity, for that use `list:capacityBytes()`).

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:isEmpty()`

  Checks if list is empty.

  Returns:

    - `boolean`

- `ac.GenericList:capacity()`

  Capacity of the list.

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:capacityBytes()`

  Size of list in bytes (capacity).

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:reserve(newSize)`

  Makes sure list can fit `newSize` of elements without reallocating memory.

  Parameters:

    1. `newSize`: `integer`

  Returns:

    - `integer`

- `ac.GenericList:shrinkToFit()`

  If capacity is greater than current size, reallocates a smaller bit of memory and moves data there.
function _ac_genericList:shrinkToFit() end

- `ac.GenericList:clear()`

  Removes all elements.
function _ac_genericList:clear() end

- `ac.GenericList:clone()`

  Creates a new list with the same contents as the existing one.

  Returns:

    - `ac.GenericList`
## Class ffilibex

## Function worker.sleep(time)
Available only in background worker scripts. Sleep function pauses execution for a certain time. 
Before unpaused, any callbacks (such as `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()` and
other custom enqueued callbacks) will be called. This is the only way for those callbacks to fire in a background worker. Note:
if parent thread is closed, `worker.sleep()` won’t return back and instead script will be unloaded, this way worker can be reloaded
as well.

If your worker does a lot of async operations, consider using `worker.wait()` instead, setting resulting value with `worker.result`.
Or maybe not even use anything at all: for basic (non-repeating) callbacks, timers and intervals script will continue running until
all the postponed actions are complete (updating once every 100 ms).

  Parameters:

  1. `time`: `number` Time in seconds to pause worker by.
## Function worker.wait(time)
Wait for `worker.result` value to be set. Stops the worker once `worker.result` value has been provided (or any `error()` has been raised).
Works the best if your worker uses a lot of async operations.

  Parameters:

  1. `time`: `number?` Time in seconds for timeout. Default value: 60. Feel free to pass something like `math.huge` if you don’t need timeout for some reason.
## Function ac.onRelease(callback, item)
Adds a callback which might be called when script is unloading. Use it for some state reversion, but
don’t rely on it too much. For example, if Assetto Corsa would crash or just close rapidly, it would not
be called. It should be called when scripts reload though.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(item: T)`

  2. `item`: `T?` Optional parameter. If provided, will be passed to callback on release, but stored with a weak reference, so it could still be GCed before that (in that case, callback won’t be called at all).

  Returns:

  - `fun`
## Function package.add(dir)
For easy import of scripts from subdirectories. Provide it a name of a directory relative
to main script folder and it would add that directory to paths it searches for.

  Parameters:

  1. `dir`: `string`
## Function ac.onOnlineWelcome(callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when server welcome message and extended config arrive.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(message: string, config: ac.INIConfig)` Callback function.

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`

# Module common/class.lua

## Function ClassBase.isInstanceOf(obj)
Checks if object is an instance of a class created by `class()` function.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `any|nil` Any table, vector, nil, anything.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if type of `obj` is `ClassBase` or any class inheriting from it.
## Function ClassBase:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)
Checks if ClassBase is a subsclass of a class created by `class()` function. It wouldn’t be, function is here just for
keeping things even.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` Always false.
## Function ClassBase:subclass(...)
Creates a new class. Pretty much the same as calling `class()` (all classes are inheriting from `ClassBase` anyway).

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function ClassBase:include(mixin)
Adds a mixin to all subsequently created classes. Use it early in case you want to add a method or some data to all of your objects.
If `mixin` has a property `included`, it would be called each time new class is created with a reference to the newly created class.

  Parameters:

  1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin`
## Function ClassBase:subclassed(classDefinition)
Define this function and it would be called each time a new class without a parent (or `ClassBase` for parent) is created.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition`
## Function ClassPool.isInstanceOf(obj)
Checks if object is an instance of a class with pooling active.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `any|nil` Any table, vector, nil, anything.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if type of `obj` is `ClassPool` or any class inheriting from it.
## Function ClassPool:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)
Checks if ClassPool is a subsclass of a class created by `class()` function. It wouldn’t be unless you’re passing `ClassBase`, function is here just for
keeping things even.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassBase` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if you’ve passed ClassBase here.
## Function ClassPool:subclass(...)
Creates a new class with pooling. Pretty much the same as calling `class(class.Pool, ...)` (all classes with `class.Pool` are 
inheriting from `ClassPool` anyway).

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function ClassPool:include(mixin)
Adds a mixin to subsequently created classes with pooling. Use it early in case you want to add a method or some data to all of your objects that use pooling.
If `mixin` has a property `included`, it would be called each time new class with pooling is created with a reference to the newly created class.

  Parameters:

  1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin`
## Function ClassPool:subclassed(classDefinition)
Define this function and it would be called each time a new pooling class without a parent (or `ClassPool` for parent) is created.

  Parameters:

  1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition`
## Class ClassBase
A base class. Note: all classes are inheriting from this one even if they’re not using
`ClassBase` as a parent class explicitly. You might still want to put it in EmmyDoc comment to get hints for functions like `YourClass.isInstanceOf()`.

- `ClassBase:isInstanceOf(classDefinition)`

  Checks if object is an instance of this class. Can be used either as `obj:isInstanceOf(YourClass)` or, as a safer alternative,
`YourClass.isInstanceOf(obj)` — this one would work even if `obj` is nil, a number, a vector, anything like that. And in all of those
cases, of course, it would return `false`.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Used with `obj:isInstanceOf(YourClass)` variant.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` True if argument is an instance of this class.

- `ClassBase:isSubclassOf(classDefinition)`

  Class method. Checks if class itself is a child class of a different class (or a child of a child, etc). 
Can be used as `YourClass:isInstanceOf(YourOtherClass)`.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` Class created by `class()` function.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` True if this class is a child of another class (or a child of a child, etc).

- `ClassBase:include(mixin)`

  Class method. Includes mixin, adding new methods to a preexising class. If mixin has a property `included`, it will be called
with an argument referencing a class mixin is being added to. Can be used as `YourClass:include({ newMethod = function(self, arg) end })`.

  Parameters:

    1. `mixin`: `ClassMixin` Any mixin.

- `ClassBase:subclass(...)`

  Class method. Creates a new child class.

  Returns:

    - `ClassDefinition` New class definition

- `ClassBase:subclassed(classDefinition)`

  Class method. Called when a new child class is created using this class as a parent one. Redefine this function for
your class if you need some advanced processing, like adding new methods to a child class.

  Parameters:

    1. `classDefinition`: `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Class ClassPool
A base class for objects with pooling. Doesn’t add anything, but you can add it as a parent class
so that `recycled()` would be documented.

- `ClassPool:recycled()`

  Called when object is about to get recycled.

  Returns:

    - `boolean` Return false if this object should not be recycled and instead destroyed as usual.
## Function class(name, parentClass, flags)
Create a new class. Example:

```lua
local MyClass = class('MyClass')        -- class declaration

function MyClass:initialize(arg1, arg2) -- constructor
  self.myField = arg1 + arg2            -- field
end

function MyClass:doMyThing()            -- method
  print(self.myField)
end

local instance = MyClass(1, 2)          -- creating instance of a class
instance:doMyThing()                    -- calling a method
```

Whole thing is very similar to [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass), but it’s a different
implementation that should be somewhat faster. Main differences:

1. Class name is stored in `YourClass.__name` instead of `YourClass.name`.

2. There is no `.static` subtable, all static fields and methods are instead stored in main class
   table and thus are available as instance fields and methods as well (that’s why `YourClass.name` was
   renamed to `YourClass.__name`, to avoid possible confusion with a common field name). It’s a bit
   messier, especially with class methods such as `:subclass()`, but it has some advantages as well:
   objects creation is faster, and it’s more EmmyLua-friendly (both of which is what it’s all about).

3. Overloaded `__tostring`, `__len` and `__call` are inherited, but not other operators.

4. Method `YourClass.allocate()` works differently here and is used to create a simple table which will be
   passed to `setmetatable()`. This can help with performance if objects are created often.

Everything else should work the same, including inheritance and mixins. As for performance, some simple
tests show up to 30% faster objects creation and 40% less memory used for objects with two fields when
using `YourClass.allocate()` method instead of `YourClass:initialize()` (that alone gives about 15% increase in speed
when creating an object with two fields):

```lua
function YourClass.allocate(arg1, arg2)  -- notice . instead of :
  return { myField = arg1 + arg2 }     -- also notice, methods are not available at this stage
end
```

Other differences (new features rather than something breaking compatibility) and important notes:

1. Function `class()` takes string for class name, another class to act like a parent,
   allocate and initialize functions and flags. Everything is optional and can go in any order (with one caveat:
   allocate function should go before initialize function unless you’re using `class.Pool`). Generally there is no
   benefit in passing allocate and initialize functions here though.

2. With flag `class.NoInitialize` constructor would not look for `YourClass:initialize()` method to call at all,
   instead using only `YourClass.allocate()`. Might speed things up a bit further.

3. If you’re creating new instances really often, there is a `class.Pool` flag. It would disable the use of
   `YourClass.allocate()`, but instead allow to reuse unused objects by using `class.recycle(object)`. Recycled objects
   would end up in a pool of objects to be reused next time an instance would need to be created. Of course, it
   introduces a whole new type of errors (imagine storing a reference to a recycled item somewhere not knowing it was
   recycled and now represents something else entirely), so please be careful.

   Note 1: Method `class.recycle()` can be used with nils or non-recycle, no need to have extra checks before calling it.
 
   Note 2: Instances of child classes won’t end up in parent class pool. For such arrangements, consider adding pooling
           flag to all of child classes where appropriate.

4. Before recycling, method `YourClass:recycled()` will be called. Good time to recycle any inner elements. Also,
   return `false` from it and object would not be recycled at all.

5. To check type, `YourClass.isInstanceOf(item)` can also be used. Notice that it’s a static method, no “:” here.

All classes are considered children classes of `ClassBase`, that one is mostly for EmmyLua to pick up methods like 
`YourClass.isInstanceOf(object)`. If you’re creating your own class and want to use such methods, just add `: ClassBase`
to its EmmyLua annotation. And objects with pooling are children of `ClassPool` which is a child of `ClassBase`. Note: 
to speed things up, those classes aren’t fully real, but you can access them and their methods and even call things like
`ClassBase:include()`. Please read documentation for those functions before using them though, just to check.

  Parameters:

  1. `name`: `string` Class name.

  2. `parentClass`: `ClassBase` Parent class.

  3. `flags`: `nil|integer|`class.NoInitialize`|`class.Pool`|`class.Minimal`` Flags.

  Returns:

  - `ClassDefinition` New class definition
## Function class.recycle(item)
Recycle an item to its pool, to speed up creation and reduce work for GC. Requires class to be created with
`class.Pool` flag.

This method has protection from double recycling, recycling nils or non-recycleable items, so don’t worry about it.

  Parameters:

  1. `item`: `ClassPool|nil`
## Function class.emmy(classFn, constructorFn) return constructorFn
A trick to get `class()` to work with EmmyLua annotations nicely. Call `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.initialize)`
or `class.emmy(YourClass, YourClass.allocate)` (whatever you’re using) and it would give you a constructor function.
Then, use it for local reference or as a return value from module. For best results add annotations to function you’re
passing here, such as return value or argument types.

In reality is simply returns the class back and ignores second argument, but because of this definition EmmyLua thinks
it got the constructor.

  1. `classFn`: `T1`

  2. `constructorFn`: `T2`

  Returns:

Sets a callback which will be called when car crosses a certain point on a track. Won’t be triggered if car is in pitlane or recently jumped.
Time is relative to the same point as `ac.SimState.time`. Tracking happens on physics thread and is interpolated based on car position, so it
should be precise more than within 3 ms steps.

  Parameters:

  1. `carIndex`: `integer` 0-based car index, or -1 for an event to be called for all cars.

  2. `progress`: `number` Track progress from 0 to 1.

  3. `callback`: `fun(carIndex: integer, timeMs: number)`

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function ac.onSessionStart(callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when a new session starts (or restarts). Doesn’t get triggered at the start of the race (Lua scripts load when
the first session is already up and running to ensure the overall state of the sim is complete)!

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(sessionIndex: integer, restarted: boolean)`

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function ac.onResolutionChange(callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when AC resolution changes. Happens when window size changes, or when making a screenshot.
Note: some scripts, such as WeatherFX style or post-processing script, reload completely when resolution changes, but if they’d call
this function at any point, they would no longer reload. Instead CSP assumes they can handle resolution changes on their side.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(newSize: vec2, makingScreenshot: boolean)`

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function ac.onTyresSetChange(carIndex, callback)
Sets a callback which will be called when selected tyres change for some car. For car scripts to track changes in their own car, use `car.index` as first argument.
 Note: for physics scripts this even might come a few frames late, but it shouldn’t be a major issue since tyres changes only happen when car is stationary anyway.

  Parameters:

  1. `carIndex`: `integer` 0-based car index, or -1 for an event to be called for all cars.

  2. `callback`: `fun(carIndex: integer, setIndex: integer, shortName: string, longName: string)`

  Returns:

  - `ac.Disposable`
## Function ac.onClientConnected(callback)

Returns time in seconds from script start (with high precision).

  Returns:

  - `number` Seconds.
## Function os.preciseGameTime()

## Function os.onURL(mask, callback, priority)
Sets a callback which will be called when CSP itself or a CSP Lua script tries to open an URL. Return `true` if you’re handling URL, so the event would be stopped.

  Parameters:

  1. `mask`: `string` Regular expression to check URLs against of.

  2. `callback`: `fun(url: string): boolean`

  3. `priority`: `integer?` Smaller values mean script would be the last to get URL (if other scripts wouldn’t intercept it). Default value: 0.

## Function os.setCurrentFolder(filename)
Changes current directory. Any argument `path`, when parsed and found not to be absolute, will be resolved against current directory.
By default, uses AC root folder. Any change only applies to the current script only. Current path resets when script is reloaded.

Changes behavior of images and assets lookup as well (by default it scans script folder, CSP folder and then root folder looking for a file, *which might cause some issues and negatively affect performance).

 For scripts without I/O access, only folders script can read from can be used here.

 Note: as of 0.2.6, some API functions might still use AC root folder. This will be fixed in the future, please do not rely on this behavior!

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `path`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function os.dateGlobal(format, timestamp)
Returns formatted date. Same as `os.date()`, but returned value does not include system timezome.

  Parameters:

  1. `msg`: `string`

  2. `type`: `integer?` Type of MessageBox according to WinAPI. Default value: 0.

  Returns:

  - `integer`

## Function string.urlParse(self, plusForSpaces)
Parses URL. Added in 0.3.0-preview238. Any missing components will be returned as empty strings. Generally, has
semantics akin to `new URL()` from JavaScript, and uses the same underlying library for parsing. If failed to
parse, returns `nil`.

Calling `tostring()` on returned table will get the normalized URL back. Also,
returned table has its own comparison, logic, allowing to compare different URLs together with ease.

You can also alter any fields of the returned table and use `tostring()` to get the altered URL back. Note: if present,
`hostname` will be used, so, override `hostname` and `port` instead of `host`. Also, `searchParams`, if present, will
be used, ignoring `search`.

Method `:getSearchParam()` is a simple shortcut returning the first item with matching key from `searchParams`.

  Parameters:

  1. `self`: `string`

  2. `plusForSpaces`: `boolean?` Use `'+'` for space symbol (works for URLs, but if a regular URL encoding is needed, might be getting in a way). Default value: `true`.

  Returns:

  - `nil|`

# Module common/internal.lua

## Function setTimeout(callback, delay, uniqueKey)
Runs callback after certain time. Returns cancellation ID.
Note: all callbacks will be ran before `update()` call,
and they would only ran when script runs. So if your script is executed each frame and AC runs at 60 FPS, smallest interval
would be 0.016 s, and anything lower that you’d set would still act like 0.016 s. Also, intervals would only be called once
per frame.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun()`

  2. `delay`: `number?` Delay time in seconds. Default value: 0.

  3. `uniqueKey`: `any?` Unique key: if set, timer wouldn’t be added unless there is no more active timers with such ID.

  Returns:

  - `integer`
## Function setInterval(callback, period, uniqueKey)
Repeteadly runs callback after certain time. Returns cancellation ID.
Note: all callbacks will be ran before `update()` call,
and they would only ran when script runs. So if your script is executed each frame and AC runs at 60 FPS, smallest interval
would be 0.016 s, and anything lower that you’d set would still act like 0.016 s. Also, intervals would only be called once
per frame.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(): function?` Return `clearInterval` (actual function) to clear interval.

  2. `period`: `number?` Period time in seconds. Default value: 0.

  3. `uniqueKey`: `any?` Unique key: if set, timer wouldn’t be added unless there is no more active timers with such ID.

  Returns:

  - `integer`
## Function clearTimeout(cancellationID)
Stops timeout. If called with an ID from `setInterval`, works as well.

  Parameters:

  1. `cancellationID`: `integer` Value earlier retuned by `setTimeout()`. If a non-numerical value is passed (like a `nil`), call is ignored and returns `false`.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if timeout with such ID has been found and stopped.
## Function clearInterval(cancellationID)
Stops interval. Return this value from a callback to cancel out an interval.
If called with an ID from `setTimeout`, works as well.

  Parameters:

  1. `cancellationID`: `integer` Value earlier retuned by `setInterval()`. If a non-numerical value is passed (like a `nil`), call is ignored and returns `false`.

  Returns:

  - `boolean` True if interval with such ID has been found and stopped.

# Module common/io.lua

## Class io.FileAttributes
Structure containing various file or directory attributes, including various flags and dates. All values are precomputed and ready to be used (there is
no overhead in accessing them once you get the structure).
## Function io.scanDir(directory, mask, callback, callbackData)
Scan directory and call callback function for each of files, passing file name (not full name, but only name of the file) and attributes. If callback function would return
a non-nil value, iteration will stop and value returned by callback would return from this function. This could be used to
find a certain file without going through all files in the directory. Optionally, a mask can be used to pre-filter received files
entries.

If callback function is not provided, it’ll return list of files instead (file names only).

System entries “.” and “..” will not be included in the list of files. Accessing attributes does not add extra cost.

  Parameters:

  1. `directory`: `string` Directory to look for files in. Note: directory is relative to current directory, not to script directory. For AC in general it’s an AC root directory, but do not rely on it, instead use `ac.getFolder(ac.FolderID.Root)`.

  2. `mask`: `string?` Mask in a form of usual “*.*”. Default value: '*'.

  3. `callback`: `fun(fileName: string, fileAttributes: io.FileAttributes, callbackData: TCallbackData): TReturn?` Callback which will be ran for every file in directory fitting mask until it would return a non-nil value.

  4. `callbackData`: `TCallbackData?` Callback data that will be passed to callback as third argument, to avoid creating a capture.

  Returns:

  - `TReturn`

# Module common/ac_extras_connect.lua

## Function ac.connect(layout, keepLive, namespace)
Creates a new shared structure to quickly exchange data between different Lua scripts within a session. Example:
```lua
local sharedData = ac.connect{
  ac.StructItem.key('myChannel'),        -- optional, to avoid collisions
  someString = ac.StructItem.string(24), -- 24 is for capacity
  someInt = ac.StructItem.int(),
  someDouble = ac.StructItem.double(),
  someVec = ac.StructItem.vec3()
}
```

Note: to connect two scripts, both of them chould use `ac.connect()` and pass exactly the same layouts. Also, consider using more
specific names to avoid possible unwanted collisions. For example, instead of using `value = ac.StructItem.int()` which might be
used somewhere else, use `weatherBrightnessValue = ac.StructItem.int()`. Or, simply add `ac.StructItem.key('myUniqueKey')`.

For safety reasons, car scripts can only connect to other car scripts, and track scripts can only connect to other track scripts.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  2. `keepLive`: `boolean?` Set to true to keep structure even if any references were removed or script was unloaded.

  3. `namespace`: `nil|ac.SharedNamespace` Optional namespace stopping scripts of certain types to access data of scripts with different types. For more details check `ac.SharedNamespace` documentation.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function ac.StructItem.combine(layout, compact)
Create a new struct from a given layout. Could be used in calls like `ac.structBytes()` and `ac.fillStructWithBytes()`. Each call defines and creates a new struct, so don’t
call them each frame, I believe LuaJIT doesn’t do garbage collection on struct definitions.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T`

  2. `compact`: `boolean?`

  Returns:

  1. `T`

  2. `integer` Structure size.

  3. `string` Structure name.

# Module common/ac_struct_item.lua

## Function ac.StructItem.key(key)
Adds a key to a structure to ensure its uniqueness. Consider using something like “yourUsername.yourContentID” or something
like that for a key, so that your data would not interfere with data from Lua scripts written by other developers. Note:
if you’re exchanging data between physics and graphics thread in your car, you might have to append `car.index` to there as
well so that different cars would have either own data things.

  Returns:

  - `nil`
## Function ac.StructItem.explicit(alignment, packing)
Enables explicit ordering for your structures.
By default, CSP will reorder fields in your structures for optimal data packing. Because all scripts written in Lua share the same algorithm,
it’s all fine and good, but if you want for your script to exchange data with other programs, explicit order would work much better.

  Parameters:

  1. `alignment`: `integer?` Optional override for alignment of child structures.

  2. `packing`: `integer?` Optional overrider for packing of fields.

  Returns:

  - `nil`
## Function ac.StructItem.half()

  - `string`
## Function ac.StructItem.mat3x3()

  Returns:

  - `mat3x3`
## Function ac.StructItem.mat4x4()

  Returns:

  - `mat4x4`
## Function ac.StructItem.transform(compactPosition, compactRotation, rangeFrom, rangeTo)
Matrix packed to 6, 9 or 12 bytes (depending on settings).

Note: to update value you need to use assignment operator (`.field = newValue`), altering matrix of this property with methods like
`:mulSelf()` only changes unpacked value on your side, but not the actual structure value.

  Parameters:

  1. `compactPosition`: `boolean?` If `true`, position is packed into 3 bytes, otherwise it will take 6 bytes. Default value: `false`.

  2. `compactRotation`: `boolean?` If `true`, rotation is packed into 3 bytes, otherwise it will take 6 bytes. Default value: `false`.

  3. `rangeFrom`: `number|vec3?` Minimal expected position. Pass it together with `rangeTo` to encode position data more efficiently.

  4. `rangeTo`: `number|vec3?` Maximum expected position. Pass it together with `rangeFrom` to encode position data more efficiently.

  Returns:

  - `mat4x4`
## Function ac.StructItem.build(layout)
Simply create a new FFI structure with a given layout. Doesn’t connect to anything.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  Returns:

  - `T`

# Module common/ac_extras_hashspace.lua

# Module common/ac_extras_numlut.lua

## Function ac.Lut(data, hsvColumns)

  2. `hsvColumns`: `integer[]` 1-based indices of columns storing HSV data. Such columns, of course, will be interpolated differently (for example, mixing hues 350 and 20 would produce 10).

  Returns:

  - `ac.Lut`
## Function ac.LutJit:new(o, data, hsvRows)
Creates new ac.LuaJit instance. Deprecated and broken, use `ac.Lut` instead.

  Parameters:

  2. `hsvRows`: `integer[]`  1-based indices of columns (not rows) storing HSV values in them.

  Returns:

  - `table`

# Module common/ac_extras_onlineevent.lua

## Function ac.OnlineEvent(layout, callback, namespace, udp, params)
Creates a new type of online event to exchange between scripts running on different clients in an online
race. Example:
```lua
local chatMessageEvent = ac.OnlineEvent({
  -- message structure layout:
  message = ac.StructItem.string(50),
  mood = ac.StructItem.float(),
}, function (sender, data)
  -- got a message from other client (or ourselves; in such case `sender.index` would be 0):
  ac.debug('Got message: from', sender and sender.index or -1)
  ac.debug('Got message: text', data.message)
  ac.debug('Got message: mood', data.mood)
end)

-- sending a new message:
chatMessageEvent{ message = 'hello world', mood = 5 }
```

Note: to exchange messages between two scripts, both of them chould use `ac.OnlineEvent()` and pass exactly the same layouts. Also, consider using more
specific names to avoid possible unwanted collisions. For example, instead of using `value = ac.StructItem.int()` which might be
used somewhere else, use `mySpecificValue = ac.StructItem.int()`. Or, simply add `ac.StructItem.key('myUniqueKey')`.

For safety reasons, car scripts can only exchange messages with other car scripts, and track scripts can only exchange messages with other track scripts.
Your own messages will arrive to you as well unless you were to use `target` with ID different from your session ID, you might need to filter out those
messages.

If the server is not a custom AC Server (use `ac.getSim().directMessagingAvailable` to check), but the original implementation, following restrictions apply:
- Each message should be smaller than 175 bytes.
- At least 200 ms should pass between sending messages.
- UDP messages are not available (those require `ac.getSim().directUDPMessagingAvailable` flag).
- Don’t use this system to exchange data too often: it uses chat messages to transfer data, so it’s far from optimal.

When sending UDP packets, consider adding a byte for packet index and checking it upon receiving: UDP packets might arrive out-of-order and more.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Alternatively, you can pass a string for the body of the structure here, but be careful with it.

  2. `callback`: `fun(sender: ac.StateCar|nil, message: T)` Callback that will be called when a new message of this type is received. Note: it would be called even if message was sent from this script. Use `sender` to check message origin: if it’s `nil`, message has come from the server, if its `.index` is 0, message has come from this client (and possibly this script).

  3. `namespace`: `nil|ac.SharedNamespace` Optional namespace stopping scripts of certain types to access data of scripts with different types. For more details check `ac.SharedNamespace` documentation.

  4. `udp`: `nil|boolean|{range: number}` Pass `true` to use UDP messages (available for Lua apps and online scripts only). Use `ac.getSim().directUDPMessagingAvailable` to check if you could use `udp` flag before hand. Note: enabling this option means `repeatForNewConnections` parameter will be ignored. Alternatively, pass a table with advanced UDP settings.

  5. `params`: `{processPostponed: boolean?}?` Extra params. Set `processPostponed` to process previously received TCP messages (up to 256, callback will be called in the next frame for all messages from first to last).

  Returns:

  1. `fun`

  2. `fun`

# Module common/ac_extras_connectmmf.lua

  Parameters:

  1. `filename`: `string` Shared memory file filename (without “Local\” bit).

  2. `layout`: `T` String for the body of the structure.

  3. `persist`: `boolean?` Keep file alive even after the script stopped or the variable was cleared by garbage collector. Default value: `false`.

## Class ac.StoredValue

- `ac.StoredValue:get()`

    - `string|number|boolean|vec2|vec3|vec4|rgb|rgbm`

- `ac.StoredValue:set(value)`

  Parameters:

    1. `value`: `string|number|boolean|vec2|vec3|vec4|rgb|rgbm`
## Function ac.storage(layout, keyPrefix)
Storage function. Easiest way to use is to pass it a table with default values — it would give you a table back
which would load values on reads and save values on writes. Values have to be either strings, numbers, booleans,
vectors or colors. Example:
```lua
local storedValues = ac.storage{
  someKey = 15,
  someStringValue = 20
}
storedValues.someKey = 20
```
Alternatively, you can use it as a function which would take a key and a default value and return you an
`ac.StoredValue` wrapper with methods `:get()` and `:set(newValue)`:
```lua
local stored = ac.storage('someKey', 15)
stored:get()
stored:set(20)
```
Or, just access it directly in `localStorage` style of JavaScript. Similar to JavaScript, this way you can only store
strings:

# Module common/ac_physics_unrestricted.lua



# Module common/stringify.lua

## Function stringify(obj, compact, depthLimit)
Serialize Lua value (table, number, string, etc.) in a Lua table format (similar to how `JSON.stringify` in JavaScript
generates a thing with JavaScript syntax). Format seems to be called Luaon. Most of Lua entities are supported, including array-like tables, table
tables and mixed ones. CSP API things, such as vectors or colors, are also supported. For things like threads,
functions or unknown cdata types instead a placeholder object will be created.

Circular references also result in creating similar objects, for example: `t = {1, 2, 3, t}` would result in
`{ 1, 2, 3, { type = 'circular reference' } }`.

If any table in given data would have a `__stringify()` function, it would be called as a method (so first argument
would be the table with `__stringify` itself). If that function would return a string, that string will be used
instead of regular table serialization. The idea is for classes to define a method like this and output a line of code
which could be used to create a new instance like this on deserialization. Note: for such like to use a custom function
like a class constructor, you would either need to register that function with a certain name or provide a table referring
to it on deserialization. That’s because although deserialization uses `load()` function to parse and run data as Lua code,
it wouldn’t allow code to access existing functions by default.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil` Object to serialize.

  2. `compact`: `boolean?` If true, resulting string would not have spaces and line breaks, slightly faster and a lot more compact.

  3. `depthLimit`: `integer?` Limits how deep serialization would go. Default value: 20.

  Returns:

  - `string` String with input data presented in Lua syntax.
## Function stringify.parse(serialized, namespace)
Parse a string with Lua table syntax into a Lua object (table, number, string, vector, etc.), can support custom objects as well.
Only functions from `namespace` can be used (as well as vectors and functions registered earlier with `stringify.register()`),
so if you’re using custom classes, make sure to either register them earlier or pass them in `namespace` table. Alternatively,
you can just pass `_G` as `namespace`, but it might be pretty unsecure, so maybe don’t do it.

Would raise an error if failed to parse or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string` Serialized data.

  2. `namespace`: `table|nil` Namespace table. Serialized data would be evaluated as Lua code and would have access to it.

  Returns:

  - `table|number|string|boolean|nil`
## Function stringify.tryParse(serialized, namespace, fallback)
Parse a string with Lua table syntax into a Lua object (table, number, string, vector, etc.), can support custom objects as well.
Only functions from `namespace` can be used (as well as vectors and functions registered earlier with `stringify.register()`),
so if you’re using custom classes, make sure to either register them earlier or pass them in `namespace` table. Alternatively,
you can just pass `_G` as `namespace`, but it might be pretty unsecure, so maybe don’t do it.

Returns fallback value if failed to parse, or if `serialized` is empty or not set, or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string?` Serialized data.

  2. `namespace`: `table|nil` Namespace table. Serialized data would be evaluated as Lua code and would have access to it.

  3. `fallback`: `T|nil` Value to return if parsing failed.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Function stringify.register(name, fn)
Registers a new initializer function with a given name.

  Parameters:

  1. `name`: `string` Name of an initializer (how serialized data would refer to it).

  2. `fn`: `function` Initializer function (returning value for serialized data to use).
## Function stringify.substep(out, ptr, obj, lineBreak, depthLimit)
Serialization substep. Works similar to `stringify()` itself, but instead of returning string simply adds new terms to
`out` table. Use it in custom `__stringify` methods for serializing child items if you need the best performance.

  Parameters:

  1. `out`: `string[]` Output table with words to concatenate later (without any joining string).

  2. `ptr`: `integer` Position within `out` table to write next word into. At the very start, when table is empty, it would be 1.

  3. `obj`: `any` Item to serialize.

  4. `lineBreak`: `string|nil` Line break with some spaces for aligning child items, or `nil` if compact stringify mode is used. One tab is two spaces.

  5. `depthLimit`: `integer` Limits how many steps down serialization can go. If 0 or below, no tables would be serialized.

  Returns:

  - `integer` Updated `ptr` value (if one item was added to `out`, should increase by 1).
## Function stringify.binary(obj)
Different serializer, produces binary data instead of human-readable. Faster and with even more compact output, but not human-readable.

  Parameters:

  1. `obj`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil` Object to serialize.

  Returns:

  - `string` String with input data presented in binary format, so it won’t be readable and will contain zero bytes.
## Function stringify.binary.parse(serialized)
Parses binary data prepared with `stringify.binary()`.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string` Serialized data.

  Returns:

  - `table|number|string|boolean|nil`
## Function stringify.binary.tryParse(serialized, fallback)
Tries to parse binary data prepared with `stringify.binary()`.

Returns fallback value if failed to parse, or if `serialized` is empty or not set, or if any of initializers would raise an error.

  Parameters:

  1. `serialized`: `string?` Serialized data.

  2. `fallback`: `T|nil` Value to return if parsing failed.

  Returns:

  - `T`
## Class ClassStringifiable
A small helper to add as a parent class for EmmyLua to work better.

- `ClassStringifiable:__stringify(out, ptr, obj, lineBreak, depthLimit)`

  Serialize instance of class. Can either return a `string`, or construct it into `out` table and return a new position in it. String itself should be a like of
Lua code which would reconstruct the object on deserialization. Don’t forget to either register referred function with `stringify.register()` or provide
a reference to it in `namespace` table with `stringify.parse()`.

Note: to serialize sub-objects, such as constructor arguments, you can use `stringify()` or `stringify.substep()` if you’re using an approach with
manually constructing `out` table. Alternatively for basic types you can use `string.format()`: “%q” would give you a string in Lua format, so you can use it
like so:
```lua
function MyClass:__serialize()
  return string.format('MyClass(%q, %s)', self.stringName, self.numericalCounter)
end
```

  Parameters:

    1. `out`: `string[]` Output table with words to concatenate later (without any joining string).

    2. `ptr`: `integer` Position within `out` table to write next word into. At the very start, when table is empty, it would be 1.

    3. `obj`: `any` Item to serialize.

    4. `lineBreak`: `string|nil` Line break with some spaces for aligning child items, or `nil` if compact stringify mode is used. One tab is two spaces.

    5. `depthLimit`: `integer` Limits how many steps down serialization can go. If 0 or below, no tables would be serialized.

  Returns:

    - `integer` Updated `ptr` value (if one item was added to `out`, should increase by 1).

# Module common/json.lua

## Function JSON.stringify(data)
Serializes a Lua entity (like a table) into a compact JSON.

  Parameters:

  1. `data`: `table|number|string|boolean|nil`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function JSON.parse(data)
Parses a compact JSON into a Lua entity. Note: if JSON is damaged, parser won’t throw an error, but
results might be somewhat unpredictable. It’s an intended behaviour: in 99% of cases JSON parser
used to exchange data with, for example, API endpoints, will receive correct data, but some of those
AC JSON files are pretty screwed and often include things like missing commas, comments, etc.

  Parameters:

  1. `data`: `string?`

  Returns:

  - `any`

# Module common/ac_primitive_vec2.d.lua

## Function vec2.new(x, y)
Creates new vector. It’s usually faster to create a new item with `vec2(x, y)` directly, but the way LuaJIT works,

various calls (which also makes it slightly slower).

  Returns:

  - `vec2`

  - `vec2`
## Function vec2.intersect(p1, p2, p3, p4)
Intersects two line segments, one going from `p1` to `p2` and another going from `p3` to `p4`. Returns intersection point or `nil` if there is no intersection.

  Returns:

  - `vec2`
## Function vec2(x, y)
Two-dimensional vector. All operators are overloaded. Note: creating a lot of new vectors can create extra work for garbage collector reducing overall effectiveness.
Where possible, instead of using mathematical operators consider using methods altering state of already existing vectors. So, instead of:
```lua
someVec = vec2()
…
someVec = math.normalize(vec1 + vec2) * 10
```
Consider rewriting it like:
```lua
someVec = vec2()
…
someVec:set(vec1):add(vec2):normalize():scale(10)
```

  Parameters:

  1. `x`: `number?`

  2. `y`: `number?`

## Class vec3
Three-dimensional vector. All operators are overloaded.
Note: creating a lot of new vectors can create extra work for garbage collector reducing overall effectiveness.
Where possible, instead of using mathematical operators consider using methods altering state of already existing vectors. So, instead of:
```lua
someVec = vec3()
…
someVec = math.normalize(vec1 + vec2) * 10
```
Consider rewriting it like:
```lua
someVec = vec3()
…
someVec:set(vec1):add(vec2):normalize():scale(10)
```

- `vec3.new(x, y, z)`

  Creates new vector. It’s usually faster to create a new item with `vec3(x, y, z)` directly, but the way LuaJIT works,

KN5 in the scene.

If there is a VAO patch in a ZIP file, it will be extracted next to KN5.

Note: only valid KN5 files and VAO patches are supported. Heavy caching is applied: if model was
downloaded once, it would not be re-downloaded (unlike with remote textures where proper HTTP caching
rules apply). If model was not accessed for a couple of weeks, it’ll be removed.

If you need to download several entities and do something afterwards, it might help to use some
promise Lua library.

Use `web.loadRemoteAssets()` instead.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, filename: string)`
## Function web.loadRemoteAnimation(source, callback)
Loads a ZIP file from a given URL, unpacks first KsAnim from it to a cache folder and returns
its filename through a callback. If file is already in cache storage, doesn’t do anything and
simply returns filename to it. After callback is called, that filename could be used to animate
objects in the scene. If animation was not accessed for a couple of weeks, it’ll be removed.

If you need to download several entities and do something afterwards, it might help to use some
promise Lua library.

Use `web.loadRemoteAssets()` instead.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, filename: string)`
## Function web.loadRemoteAssets(source, callback)
Loads a ZIP file from a given URL, unpacks assets from it to a cache folder and returns
path to the folder in a callback. If files are already in cache storage, doesn’t do anything and
simply returns the path. After callback is called, you can use path to the folder to get full paths to those assets.
If assets are not accessed for a couple of weeks, they’ll be removed.

Since 0.2.10, scripts with I/O access are allowed to extract all types of files using this function.

  Parameters:

  1. `source`: `string|{url: string, headers: table<string, string>, crucial: string?}` URL to download, or, since 0.2.10, a table. Field `crucial` acts similar to `crucial` of `io.extractFromZipAsync()`.

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string, folder: string)`
## Function web.resolveDNS(url, callback)
Resolve hostname, return IPv4 via a callback.

  Parameters:

  1. `url`: `string`

  2. `callback`: `fun(err: string?, response: string?)?`
## Function web.encryptKey(key)

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `string`

  Returns:

  - `string`
## Function ac.writeReplayBlob(key, data)
Writes additional data to replay. Use `ac.readReplayBlob()` to extract data later in replay mode. Data written this way is not tied to frames.
Don’t bother compressing data too much: when writing, data will be compressed automatically.

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `string` Existing data with the same key will be overwritten.

  2. `data`: `binary?`
## Function ac.readReplayBlob(key)
Reads additional data from replay if recorded with `ac.writeReplayBlob()`.

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `string`

  Returns:

  - `binary`
## Function ac.ReplayStream(layout, callback, frameDivisor)
Create a new stream for recording data to replays. Write data in returned structure if not in replay mode, read data if in replay mode (use `sim.isReplayActive` to check if you need to write or read the data).
Few important points:
 - Each frame should not exceed 256 bytes to keep replay size appropriate. Limit for car scripts is lower, only 32 bytes.
 - While data will be interpolated between frames during reading, directional vectors won’t be re-normalized.
 - If two different apps would open a stream with the same layout, they’ll share a replay entry. Since 0.2.8, they’ll also share memory block, making `ac.ReplayStream()` act similar to `ac.connect()`.
 - Each opened replay stream will persist through the entire AC session to be saved at the end. Currently, the limit is 320 streams per session (before 0.2.8, the limit was 128).
 - Default values for unitialized frames are zeroes.
 - Before 0.2.8, if game is launched in replay mode and there is no such data in replay, `ac.ReplayStream()` could return `nil`. Now, it’ll return the data, but it’ll be empty.
 - Car scripts (both visual and physics) automatically add car ID and index to the key, ensuring uniqueness. Visual scripts can’t create new streams, but can access streams created by physics scripts, making it an effective way to pass data from physics to render, automatically being recorded in replays.

  Parameters:

  1. `layout`: `T` A table containing fields of structure and their types. Use `ac.StructItem` methods to select types. Unlike other similar functions, here you shouldn’t use string, otherwise data blending won’t work.

  2. `callback`: `fun()?` Callback that will be called when replay stops. Use this callback to re-apply data from structure: at the moment of the call it will contain stuff from last recorded frame allowing you to restore the state of a simulation to when replay mode was activated.

  3. `frameDivisor`: `integer?` Set to 2 to skip one out of two frames when recording, or 3 to skip two out of three frames. Default value: `1` (no skipping). Reduces replay size.

  Returns:

  - `T` Might return `nil` if there is game is launched in replay mode and there is no such data stored in the replay.
## Function ac.accessCarPhysics()
For any physics calculations avoid using structures provided by `ac.getCar()` and such: those update with graphics thread, so
 not often enough, plus if graphics thread would experience a freeze that data might get very out of date.

  Returns:

  - `ac.StateCphysCar`

## Function ac.setSteeringDamping(value)
Changes current steering damping effect. Might not work with some wheels, or be altered by FFB postprocessing script.
Original AC uses damping for low speed effect only. Calling this function will stop that low speed damping effect from working.

## Function ac.setEngineStalling(value)
Enables or disables engine stalling. Engine with stall enabled wouldn’t automatically get extra RPM if engine is below certain
 RPM. Note: if you’re using it for recreating manual engine start up, in the future it might lead to regular manual engine starting fix
 applied to all cars getting disabled for yours.

 Since 0.2.5 with its experiment to enabling stalling for all cars, using this function will stop CSP from handling stalling on its side.

  Parameters:

  1. `value`: `boolean|`true`|`false``

## Function ac.setTyresBlankets(tyres, blanketActive)
Sets tyre blankets and invalidates current lap. If set, they would keep tyres at optimal temperature until car would reach 10 km/h, *and then they would be removed. If you need to set tyres temperature for a moving car, use `physics.setTyresTemperature()`
(to get optimal tyre temperature, use `ac.getCar(N).wheels[0].tyreOptimumTemperature`.

  Parameters:

  1. `index`: `integer`

  2. `wastegate`: `number`

  3. `isAdjustable`: `boolean|`true`|`false``
## Function ac.setTurboExtras(index, lagUp, lagDown, referenceRpm, gamma)

 Use `ac.setTurboExtras2()` instead, this one incorrectly handles lag values.

  Parameters:

  1. `index`: `integer`

  3. `lagDown`: `number`

  4. `referenceRpm`: `number`

  5. `gamma`: `number`

  3. `lagDown`: `number`

  4. `referenceRpm`: `number`

  1. `index`: `integer` 0-based index. Pass `-1` to alter final turbo value used by original AC instruments, audio and such.

  2. `newBoost`: `number?` Pass `nil` to revert to original turbo. If negative and no `instrumentsBoost` is provided, negative value is only shown visually and won’t affect physics. Default value: `nil`.

  3. `instrumentsBoost`: `number?` If set, `newBoost` can be negative, and this is the value that will be shown on CSP turbo instruments. Default value: `nil`.
## Function ac.replaceClutch(callback, disengageSafetyProtocols)
Use this function to override clutch implementation entirely (call it once at the start of your physics script, the changes will be present until script reloads). 
 New implementation receives current engine and gearbox velocities, Δt and clutch input and should output the torque going back to the engine
 and the torque going to the gearbox. When engine is spinning faster than car (and the car is accelerating), resulting engine torque should be negative, and resulting gearbox torque should
 be positive. 
 
 Function also receives engine and root inertia values, but for the physics models I know of, you shouldn’t need them. Still, they are provided just in case.
 
 Input speeds are in rad/s. Be careful, some models expect data to be in RPM instead. To convert, you can use `local engineRPM = engineVelocity * (30 / math.pi)`.
 
 Note: clutch (and this function) won’t be used if it’s in a locked state. Use `ac.overrideSpecificValue(ac.CarPhysicsValueID.DrivetrainOpenThreshold, 0)` to force drivetrain
 to stay open at all times.
 
 For reference, original Kunos clutch:
 ```lua
 local maxClutchTorque = ac.INIConfig.carData(car.index, 'drivetrain.ini'):get('CLUTCH', 'MAX_TORQUE', 1000)
 ac.replaceClutch(function (engineVelocity, rootVelocity, engineInertia, rootInertia, clutchAmount, dt)
   local speedDifference = engineVelocity - rootVelocity
   local speedK = speedDifference / (math.abs(speedDifference) + 4)
   local clutchTorque = speedK * clutchAmount * maxClutchTorque
   return -clutchTorque, clutchTorque
 end)
 ```
 
 One more thing, most of custom physics scripts functions aren’t available from these callbacks to keep things a bit faster and cleaner. Please try to use nothing but simple math in there.

  Parameters:

  1. `callback`: `fun(engineVelocity: number, rootVelocity: number, engineInertia: number, rootInertia: number, clutchAmount: number, dt: number): number, number`

  2. `disengageSafetyProtocols`: `boolean?` Pass `true` to stop CSP from verifying the output. Can lead to instant explosions, not recommended. Default value: `false`.
## Function ac.loadRenderThreadModule(scriptName)
Create new car script operating in render thread, with access to visual car scripts API, as well as a couple more functions
allowing to add new tabs in setup menu (with new UI). 

Unlike car scripts created via CSP configs, these scripts will be created for each car nearby, and ran each frame, so please don’t use it
excessively. Ideally, don’t create it for extra cars, skipping secondary cars (`car.index ~= 0`) or AI-controlled cars (`car.isAIControlled`).
 
Calling it more than once will raise an error. Keep in mind, each script takes quite a few MB of memory, and some time to initialize, *so we need to not create too many of those.

  Parameters:

  1. `scriptName`: `string` Name of a file in car data folder, without “.lua”.
## Function ac.computeEngineStep(rpm, gas)
Compute basic engine step, return torque and some other values related to car state. Doesn’t include CSP engine physics extensions, only basic Kunos engine, *turbos, limiter, etc. Experimental.

  Parameters:

  2. `gas`: `number`

  Returns:

  - `number`
## Function ac.extendCarState(key, saveCallback, loadCallback)
Register functions to be called when CSP is saving and loading car state. First function is expected to return a small string (as small as possible, please) storing important data, * and the second function will be called and receive that function when it’s time to load car state.

 Please try and keep the state as compact as possible. Consider using `string.pack()` with smallest possible types.

  Parameters:

  1. `key`: `string` Key to identify the extra data. If called again with the same key, replaces old handles. Please add some version postfix to it and increment it when you change the format, so there wouldn't be a conflict.

  2. `saveCallback`: `nil|fun(): string?` Called when car state is being saved. Return `nil` if there is nothing to save at the moment.

  3. `loadCallback`: `nil|fun(data: string)` Called when car state is being loaded. Might receive `nil` if there is no saved state associated with this `key`.

  Parameters:

  1. `value`: `number?` Pass `nil` (or `math.huge`) to disable override. Default value: `nil`.
## Function ac.overrideEngineTorque(newTorque)

  3. `overrideExisting`: `boolean?` Pass `true` to remove original torque (from components such as ERS). Default value: `false`.
## Function ac.overrideBrakesTorque(tyres, torque, handbrakeTorque, discTemperature)
Overrides brakes. Once called, original braking system will be disabled for entirely of the race, so make sure to keep using
this function and set torque for all four wheels. Disc temperature is optional, but if set it will be used by visual part (eventually).
Key difference betweeen braking and handbrake is that handbrake is not affected by ABS (also keep in mind original AC only applies
handbrake to rear wheels).

If a new braking system from extended physics is enabled, this call will have no effect. Make sure to use inputs from `ac.accessCarPhysics()`
and not from `car` to operate at physics rate.

  Parameters:

  1. `tyres`: `ac.Wheel` 0-based wheel index.

  2. `torque`: `number` Value in Nm. Pass not-a-number to revert to original behaviour (for CSP v0.2.3-preview20 or newer).

Expected values are within 0…1 range and act as multipliers for braking intensity. ABS only affects brakes and not handbrake.

  Parameters:

  1. `wheelLf`: `number?` Default value: `nil`.

  2. `wheelRf`: `number?` Default value: `nil`.

  3. `wheelLr`: `number?` Default value: `nil`.

## Function ac.drawDebugLine(from, to, color, style)
Draw a line to highlight what’s going on with physics. Coordinates are in world-space. Use CSP Debug app to activate render of those lines (it’s
disabled by default to keep things fast). Still, consider removing these calls from the final version of your script to keep things even faster.

disabled by default to keep things fast). Still, consider removing these calls from the final version of your script to keep things even faster. 

 Unlike “render.” functions, this one can be called in “script.update()”, the calls will be stored to be realized later.

  Parameters:

  1. `from`: `vec3`

disabled by default to keep things fast). Still, consider removing these calls from the final version of your script to keep things even faster. 

 Unlike “render.” functions, this one can be called in “script.update()”, the calls will be stored to be realized later.

  Parameters:

  1. `center`: `vec3`

  2. `size`: `vec3`

  3. `color`: `rgbm`
## Function ac.drawDebugCross(center, size, color)
Draw a cross to highlight what’s going on with physics. Coordinates are in world-space. Use CSP Debug app to activate render of those lines (it’s

## Function ac.getScriptSetupValue(id)
Returns a reference to a custom script setup item. If there is no item with such ID, returns `nil`. Call once
and reuse returned reference to keep things fast.

 To register a new item, add to “setup.ini”:
 ```luaini
 [CUSTOM_SCRIPT_ITEM_…]
 ID=my-unique-key
 DEFAULT= ; unlike regular setup entries, something is required here
 ; other values are regular setup values
 ```

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` ID from section in “setup.ini”.

  Returns:

  - `refnumber`
## Function ac.setExtraMass(pos, mass, massBox, damping, stiffness, key)
Set extra weight to a certain position of a car. If `key` is 0, each time this function is called with a new `pos` value, *new weight will be created (can create up to 4 only). Call is free if the position, weight and mass box doesn’t change.

 Parameter `key` has been added in 0.3.0-preview147, and allows to add extra movable mass that would move relative to car body. If `key` is
 specified, up to 8 weights can be created.

 Also, new `damping` and `stiffness` parameters were added in 0.3.0-preview147 as well, allowing to create softer linkage. By default, linkage
 is pretty stiff. Using these values won’t affect performance (all links in ODE are soft).

  Parameters:

  1. `pos`: `vec3` Position in meters relative to car.

  2. `mass`: `number` Mass value in kg.

  3. `massBox`: `vec3?` Inertia box (size of a mass item in meters). Default value: `vec3(1, 1, 1)`.

  3. `index`: `ac.Wheel?` For `wheel…` values, this value specifies affected wheels.
## Class ScriptData
Note: joypad assist script runs from physics thread, so update rate is much higher. Please keep it in mind and keep
code as fast as possible.
## Function ac.getSetupValue(id)
Returns a reference to a setup item value. If there is no item with such index, returns `nil`. Call once
and reuse returned reference to keep things fast.

# Module common/ac_extras_binaryinput.lua

## Function ac.ControlButton(id, defaults)

  Parameters:

  1. `id`: `string` Name of a section in “controls.ini”. If you are adding a new input, use something like “your.namespace/Nice Name” (without square brackets or colons) to ensure there won’t be collisions and it would integrate nicely.

  2. `defaults`: `{keyboard: nil|{key: ui.KeyIndex?, ctrl: boolean?, shift: boolean?, alt: boolean?}, gamepad: nil|ac.GamepadButton, period: nil|number, hold: nil|boolean}?` Default settings if user has not configured input yet. Parameter `period` can be used to create buttons which would keep reporting as pressed (or call `:onDown()`) while held, can be configured in “controls.ini” as “REPEAT_PERIOD”; by default repeating is disable. Set parameter `hold` to a boolean value and control widget will get a “hold” switch. Buttons configured in “hold” mode return `true` on `:pressed()` when both pressed and released, as well as trigger `:onPressed()` when released too. Note: if `ac.ControlButton()` is called multiple times within a race session, only defaults from the first run will be taken into account (but if subsequent calls will have a “hold” value, button editing widget will still get a “hold” switch).

  Returns:

  - `ac.ControlButton`
## Class ac.ControlButton
A good way to listen to user pressing buttons configured in AC control settings. Handles everything for you automatically, and if you’re working
on a Lua app has a `:control()` method drawing a button showing current binding and allowing to change it in-game.

Could be used for original AC button bindings, new bindings added by CSP, or even for creating custom bindings. For that, make sure to pass a
reliably unique ID when creating a control button, maybe even prefixed by your app name.

Note: inputs for car scripts (both display and physics ones) would work only if the car is currently controlled by the user and not in a replay.
When possible, consider binding to car state instead. If your script runs at lower rate than graphics thread (skipping frames), either use `:down()`
or, better yet, sign to events, `:pressed()` call might return `false`.

    1. `callback`: `fun()`

  Returns:

    - `ac.Disposable`

- `ac.ControlButton:onReleased(callback)`
